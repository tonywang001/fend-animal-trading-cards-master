				<p class="interesting-fact">
					A turtle is any shelled reptile belonging to the order Chelonii. The term "tortoise" is more specific, referring to terrestrial turtles. (Of course, there's always an exception. In this case, the land-dwelling box turtle.) Tortoises are usually herbivorous and can't swim.

					The tortoise is the third member of the Chelonian family â€“ along with turtles and terrapins. Chelonians are also reptiles, which means they are cold-blooded and warm themselves by drawing heat from their environment. They have four legs and a shell that is joined down the sides.
